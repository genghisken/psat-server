This directory contains scripts to create all the legacy python environments for the Pan-STARRS code (in particular).
We then need to install into each environment the information given in each .txt file. Note that the most recent
version of mysqlclient does NOT work with MariaDB 10.11. (Use version 2.1.1.)
